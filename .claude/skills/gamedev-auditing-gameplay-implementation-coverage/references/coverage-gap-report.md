Return a compact report with this schema. Use file/line or document-section evidence where
available.

## Evidence Rules

- `confirmed-defect` requires a reproducible expected/observed mismatch against explicit authority.
- `implementation-gap` requires explicit authority and a complete enough code census to support
  `none found`; otherwise use `unverified`.
- `presentation-gap` requires a documented decision-changing state plus inspection of the reached
  screen.
- `probe-gap` requires existing behavior and a proposed assertion that fails under a named omission.
- `spec-conflict` does not decide which side is correct; put that decision in
  `human_decision_required`.
- `intent-unknown` is a useful result, not a softened defect claim.
- `effect_evidence` must exclude every item listed in `known_exclusions`.

## Measuring This Procedure Itself

Only relevant when the audit is the subject rather than the tool.

Freeze the procedure before applying it. On a live build the defect denominator is unknown, so
report precision of adjudicated findings and coverage deltas — newly confirmed findings and
adjudicated false positives — and do not report recall. When recall or generalization has to be
measured, run it against hidden defective cases plus a clean control, so both a miss and a
fabricated finding are observable.
