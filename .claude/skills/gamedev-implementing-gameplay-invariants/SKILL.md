# Implementing Gameplay Invariants

## Purpose

Turn design intent into concrete implementation constraints. This skill sits between game design and engine-specific coding: it converts statements such as "mashing should be worse than timed play" into invariants, implementation patterns, and validation checks that can be applied in any engine.

Use this skill even without `designing-mini-games` when a game spec contains risk/reward prose but does not say how the code will enforce it.

If the game has no design spec yet, start with `designing-mini-games` (it covers one-button and multi-input briefs).

## When to Use

- Implementing a game mechanic from a design spec or README.
- Reviewing code against a design spec before running a balance test.
- A checker or simulation shows `mono_dominant`, `tied`, or repeated-input dominance, and you already know which design promise needs a code-level invariant.
- The design mentions idle weakness, hold-only weakness, mashing weakness, safe waiting, cooldowns, combos, scoring pulses, shields, charges, or invulnerability.
- The implementation is engine-specific, but the failure mode is rule-level rather than API-level.

## When Not to Use

- Pure rendering, asset, UI, audio, build, or engine API work.
- Numeric tuning after the rule-level invariants are already enforced.
- Open-ended game design before the core rules and scoring events are known.
- Choosing a balance-repair strategy from telemetry. Start with `evaluating-gameplay-balance` when a failure has occurred and you need to diagnose the cause or choose a balance pattern; use this skill after that when the chosen fix needs a new code-level invariant.

## Required Inputs

- The design spec or README.
- The input policies that must be worse than skilled play: idle, hold-only, mashing, always-left/right, alternating spam, safe waiting, or equivalent.
- The intended skilled pattern.
- The scoring event, game-over condition, and any safety/power state.
- Any deterministic validation seed or known initial random sequence used by the project checker.
- Optional telemetry or checker output.

## Procedure

1. Extract each design promise that must be true in code:
   - "Idle is weak"
   - "Hold-only is weak"
   - "Mashing is weak"
   - "Score comes from timing"
   - "Shield is safe but costly"
   - "Landing / pulse / reflection rewards precision"

2. Rewrite each promise as an invariant:
   - Use testable language: "A tap within 12 frames of the previous tap cannot score", not "mashing is bad".
   - Include the scope: per input, per target, per hazard, per landing, per combo, per second, or per resource unit.
   - Include the consequence: no score, cooldown, exposure, resource drain, combo reset, missed aim, or visible positional cost.
   - When a scoring object can persist across frames or inputs, define its lifecycle explicitly: spawn/start, active scoring window, scored/consumed state, expiry/removal, and whether a new lifecycle can score again.
   - For repeated pulse, reflection, AoE, shield, or release scoring, require per-opportunity identity in validation logs when possible (`targetId`, `pulseId`, or equivalent) so duplicate scoring is detectable.

3. Run a policy-specific precheck before coding when the mechanic can be reasoned about from the spec:
   - For each bad policy, write whether it should die, time out safely, or survive with capped score.
   - If a bad policy can survive indefinitely, the invariant must cap or starve its score; death cannot be the weakness.
   - If random first hazards, gaps, spawns, or routes affect survivability, preview the project's deterministic validation seed and confirm the first 5-10 outcomes match the invariant assumptions.

4. Choose an implementation pattern from `references/invariant-patterns.md` if needed.

5. Check for scoring loopholes:
   - No raw score per input.
   - No reusable pulse that can score repeatedly without a new hazard/opportunity.
   - No survival scoring while the player is in a safe/low-skill state unless survival is the main mastery signal.
   - No permanent safety state with uncapped scoring.
   - No long-lived scored object that remains eligible for future score unless its lifecycle visibly resets.
   - No total-score-only validation for spam fixes; also compare score per unique opportunity or unique target when the mechanic can rescore the same object.

6. Add or review the implementation:
   - Engine-specific code belongs in the engine skill or project code.
   - This skill defines what must be true, not the exact rendering or API calls.

7. Validate:
   - Run available monotonous policies and exploratory/skilled policies.
   - Prefer invariant-specific probes before the full global ratio check: `NoInput` score/death, `HoldOnly` score/death, `SpamPress` scoring events, entity counts, resource drain, and score-per-opportunity caps.
   - For pulse/reflection/AoE fixes, log accepted/rejected inputs, pulse age or cooldown state, target/opportunity id, already-scored state, score delta, and max active entity count.
   - Define the probe's pass/fail bound before editing when possible, such as `SpamPress` score per unique target below a scripted skilled cycle, `HoldOnly` score capped below a stated rate, or max active entities below a fixed limit.
   - Confirm the known bad policy scores lower than skilled play.
   - If no simulator exists, write a short human-readable validation checklist and mark the gap.

## Invariant Template

Use this compact form in specs, PR notes, or code reviews:

```markdown
- Design promise: <prose from spec>
- Implementation invariant: <testable rule>
- Pattern: <pattern ID from references/invariant-patterns.md, e.g. cooldown, per-target-cap, resource-drain>
- Readout: <the persistent on-screen indicator that lets the player act on this rule — or why this rule changes no player decision>
- Precheck: <whether the bad policy dies, survives safely, or must be score-capped>
- Validation: <policy, telemetry, or seeded scenario that should fail if the invariant is broken>
```

`Readout` is not documentation of the rule; it is part of the rule. An invariant that changes
what the player should do, and is not drawn, is indistinguishable from an unfair game — see
"Invisible rule" below.

## Common Failure Modes

- Prose-only weakness: the README says mashing is bad, but the code gives every tap a scoring chance.
- Reusable scoring pulse: a landing, shield, AoE, or reflection pulse can score many times from repeated input.
- Safe scoring: the safest state also earns points or preserves a multiplier.
- Hidden tester patch: code special-cases a bad policy instead of creating visible game rules.
- Numeric-only fix: spawn rates or score values are changed without enforcing the missing invariant.
- Unbounded entities: scoring or hazard objects live too long, causing slow validation and spam score loops.
- Seed-specific surprise: the validation seed creates early hazards/gaps that violate design assumptions, and the issue is found only after a full GA run.
- Invariant conflict: the design requires mutually exclusive invariants (e.g., "idle must die" and "survival is the only scoring"). If resolving the conflict requires changing the Core Experience or discarding the tag relationship, report that the design is unsalvageable and recommend a Failure Report.
- **Invisible rule**: the invariant is implemented correctly, passes every value assertion, and is never drawn on screen. This is the hardest class to catch and empirically one of the most common — in one measured project, **four of nine shipped-and-fixed bugs were this same defect** (the controls, an overload trigger, and a clear condition were each perfectly correct in the simulation and invisible to the player). Value assertions cannot detect it by construction: the simulation is right. Only a readout requirement plus a screenshot can.

## Validation

A change is valid when:

- Each design promise has at least one implementation invariant.
- Each monotonous policy has a visible cost or score cap.
- Any indefinitely surviving monotonous policy has a scoring cap or score starvation rule.
- **Every invariant that changes a player decision has a persistent readout, and that readout fills *before* the situation is bad rather than firing a warning once it already is.** A gauge that tracks crowding toward a cap teaches the player to act; an alarm at the moment of overload only narrates a loss. Add the readout in the same change as the rule, and screenshot it.
- Seeded early-game random sequences have been checked when random initial hazards or gaps determine survivability.
- Skilled play has a causal route to higher score or longer meaningful survival.
- The implementation can be tested by policy comparison, telemetry, or a concrete manual checklist.

If validation is impossible, report that the invariant is specified but unverified.
